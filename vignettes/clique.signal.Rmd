## Housekeeping

This package is designed to import and compare results from
[coltron](https://pypi.org/project/coltron/), a tool for predicting 
transription factor networks from histone modification ChIP-seq data.

The engine behind this approach is the excellent [chromVAR](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4401) package.

While this package is intended to import and analyze coltron results, coltron itself 
is not a dependency. This package has relatively few dependencies and most 
are fairly standard R packages. If you use bioconductor and tidyverse, 
you probably have most of them installed already!

Also, this will only work for a pristine coltron output directory!

## Importing coltron results

Coltron predicts networks from single samples, but we want to 
compare many coltron runs efficiently.

We start by creating a data.frame holding all of the metadata we'll need.

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
devtools::load_all()
library(chromVAR, quietly = T)
library(tidyverse, quietly = T)
library(tibble)
library(stringr)
```

```{r, make-meta-df}
dir <- "~/Dropbox (Partners HealthCare)/sharedWithCollabs/cll-epi-revision/180413-fed-crc/crc/crc/"
bamdir <- "/Volumes/grail/bam/hg19/roadmap_network/"
hemesamps <- c('E032','E029','E050')
epsamps <- c('E055','E056','E059')
muscsamps <- c('E100','E089','E090')
bams <- paste0(bamdir,c(hemesamps,epsamps,muscsamps),"_H3K27AC.hg19.sorted.bam")
data.frame(SAMPLE=c(hemesamps, epsamps,muscsamps),
			CONDITION=c(rep("HEME",3),rep("EPI",3), rep("MUSC",3)),
			COLTRONDIR=paste0(dir,c(hemesamps,epsamps,muscsamps),"_H3K27AC/"),
			BAM=bams) -> mdf
```

Above, we've created a data.frame for 9 coltron runs from three different
groups. We can take a look inside to get a sense of how to set this up.

```{r explain-meta-df, echpo=F}
mdf %>% 
  lapply(as.vector) %>% 
  lapply(stringr::str_trunc, width=15) %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

You are required to provide the following fields:

* SAMPLE: Sample name.
* CONDITION: The condition variable for downstream analysis.
* COLTRONDIR: A pristine coltron output directory.
* BAM: The bam containing reads you'll use for signal quantification.

There is another possible column called QUANTSITES, 
which by default is a character vector of length 1: "SUBPEAK." This
default setting imports the *subpeaks.bed file from the coltron directory.

Optionally, you can specify a bed file for each sample in the QUANTSITES field.
The quantsites are used as a searchspace for motif finding and signal quantification.

We can import these data with a single call.

```{r make-object}
create_coltron_experiment(mdf,nthreads = 16, resizeWidth=1000) -> crc
```

This call performs several tasks at once to improve code clarity:

1. Imports data from the coltron directory.
1. calls Rsubread::featureCounts to quantify signal across regions identified in all of your 
*subpeaks.bed files or the quantsites you specify.
1. Chooses non-overlapping peaks.
1. Adds a GC bias offset for use with the chromVAR workflow.

## CRCExperiment Object

```{r show-crc-class}
crc
```

The object returned is a CRCExperiment, which holds a 
RangedSummarizedExperiment and a CRCViewList. The CRCViewList
holds instances of all of the other special classes defined for this package.

1. TranscriptionFactor
1. Clique
1. CliqueList
1. CRCView

These classes are defined so we can keep track and take advantage of
inheritance fromstandard bioconductor classes like 
GRanges and SummarizedExperiment while keeping track of which samples
all of the cliques and tfbs were originally discovered in.

The CRCExperiment inherits from RangedSummarizedExperiment.

## Alternative Workflow Branch Point

If you just wish to import the cliques or tfbs found by coltron, 
you are now free to use this object in a chromVAR workflow just like you 
would a normal RangedSummarizedExperiment.

**IMPORTANT** 
*I have not implemented a helper for clique level analysis via
motifMatchr, but this is coming and should be easy.*

## clique.signal Workflow
 
Once we have the CRCExperiment object, we can assign individual motifs to
cliques and index the ranges of the CRCExperiment by clique.

```{r ix}
clique_ix <- index_by_clique(crc)
```

This index takes the form of a sparse logical matrix, just like
the indices explained in chromVAR's vignette.

```{r show-ix}
clique_ix[1:2,1:2] %>% as.matrix %>% knitr::kable()
```

Lastly, we can call a helper function to run chromVAR's built-in
differential analysis functions in a way that makes sense for us.
Additionally, this helper aggregates results in ways that I often
use for downstream analysis. I've tried to avoid reinventing the wheel
too much - the differential testing is based on chromVAR's helper function
and will test as many conditions at once as you provide conditions.

However, sometimes we want to contrast just two groups with higher sensitivity.
For these situations, we could specify a `contrast`, where the argument is
a character vector of length 2. For example, if I wanted to directly compare
HEME and EPI conditions, I would provide `c("HEME","EPI")` as an argument.

For the purposes of this demo, we'll just go with the default.

```{r diff-wrapper}
diff <- get_diff_cliques(crc, clique_ix)

names(diff)
```
`diff` is an S3 object of class `CRCResult` with 3 slots.
Slot `diff` holds mean deviations (or mean deviation z-scores)
and adjusted p-values. Slot `scores` holds either deviations or z-scores,
depending on what you specified when calling `get_diff_cliques`. Slot `devObj`
holds the ChromVARDevations object used to generate the other tables. Any of these can of
course be discarded as necessary, but downstream plotters in this package
require some or all of these slots to function, and thus require a `CRCResult`
class object.

## Plotting

```{r}

```

## Recap

Now we can condense the workflow back - just three lines of R after your
metadata data.frame is created.

```{r recap, eval=F}
crc <- create_coltron_experiment(mdf,nthreads = 16, resizeWidth=1000)
clique_ix <- index_by_clique(crc)
diff <- get_diff_cliques(crc, clique_ix)
```
